    <!-- Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it? -->

    <!-- ANSWER - 
        <!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag in HTML. It is called a Document Type Declaration (DTD)
    The purpose of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is to inform web browsers about the type of 
    document they are parsing. Browsers use this information to determine how to interpret and 
    display the content of the web page. 
    
    <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag, but a document type declaration that specifies the HTML 
    version and helps browsers render web pages correctly and consistently.-->
    

    <!-- Qu-2 : Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?-->

    <!-- ANSWER-  
          Semantic tags in HTML are a set of elements that provide meaningful structure .
    Unlike generic div or span elements, semantic tags have descriptive names that indicate
    their intended use. These tags include elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>,
    <aside>, <footer>, and more. 
        Advantages:
        1) Improved Accessibility: By using semantic tags, you provide more meaningful information
         to assistive technologies like screen readers. This enhances the accessibility of your
          website, making it easier for people with disabilities to understand and navigate.

        2) Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines can better understand the structure 
        and hierarchy of your content when you use semantic tags. This can potentially improve
         your website's visibility in search engine results.

        3) Consistent Styling: Semantic tags have predefined default styles associated with them.
        By using these tags appropriately, you can achieve consistent styling across different
        web pages and devices.

    <!-- Qu-3: Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements? -->

    <!-- answer: HTML Tags:
        HTML tags are the markup elements used to define the structure and formatting of content
        Tags are represented by angle brackets (< and >) and appear as opening and closing tags.
            Examples of HTML tags include <p>, <div>, <h1>, <a>, etc.Tags can have attributes
        that provide additional information or modify their behavior.
        For example, the <a> tag can have an href attribute to specify the link destination.

    HTML Elements:
        HTML elements consist of the opening and closing tags, along with the content they enclose.
        Elements are made up of tags, content, and any nested elements.For example, the <p> 
        element consists of an opening tag (<p>), the content (text, images, etc.), 
    and the closing tag (</p>).
        Elements can be nested within each other, creating a hierarchical structure. 
        For instance, a <div> element can contain multiple nested elements such as <p>, 
        <h1>, and more.

    <!-- Q.6 What are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions? -->

    <!-- answer: 
       1) Improved Semantics: HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements such as <header>, 
        <nav>, <section>, and <article>, making it easier to structure
       2) Rich Multimedia Support: HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements
        (<audio> and <video>), eliminating the need for external plugins 
       3) Canvas and SVG: HTML5 includes the <canvas> element, which provides a powerful and
        flexible way to draw and render graphics, animations, and visualizations directly within
        the browser.
       4) Mobile Device Compatibility: HTML5 was designed with mobile devices in mind. 
       It introduced features like responsive design, which allows web pages to adapt to 
       different screen sizes and orientations.
       5) Improved APIs and Integration: HTML5 introduced several new JavaScript APIs, 
       including the Geolocation API, Web Storage API, Web Workers API, and more.

     <!-- Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag? -->

     <!-- answer:
     The <img> tag is specifically for embedding and displaying images, while the <figure> tag
     is used to group and represent self-contained content with an optional caption. 
     The <figure> tag is often used in conjunction with the <img> tag to associate images with
     captions or descriptions. -->
     <!-- <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"> -->
     <!-- <figure>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
        <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
      </figure> -->


      <!-- Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some
         global attributes? -->

         <!-- answer:
        HTML Tags: They are represented by opening and closing angle brackets (< and >).
        Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <a>, and so on.
        Tags define the type of element and its purpose within the HTML structure. 
    
        HTML attributes: They are added to the opening tag of an element and consist of a name
        and a value, separated by an equals sign (=).
        Attributes provide details such as the source of an image, the target of a link, 
        the dimensions of an element 
    Example of Global Attributes:
            
         1) class: Specifies one or more class names to apply CSS styles -->
         <!-- <div class="my-class">Content</div> -->

    <!-- 2) id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, often used for targeting elements with JavaScript or CSS.-->
         <!-- <h1 id="my-heading">Heading</h1> -->

    <!-- 3) title: Adds a tooltip or advisory information to an element that is displayed when the
         mouse hovers over it.-->
        <!-- <a href="#" title="Click me!">Link</a>  -->

    <!-- 4) aria-*: Used for accessibility purposes, these attributes provide additional 
        information to assistive technologies. -->
       <!-- <button aria-label="Play" aria-pressed="false">Play</button>  -->
